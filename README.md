# Perclos-based-Real-Time-Drowsiness-Detection-System-depending-on-Eye-Aspect-Ratio
Nearly 30% of road accidents happen due to the driver's drowsiness. This model uses image processing techniques, such as Haar-cascade and Perclos algorithms, to determine the driver's fatigue factor by monitoring him in real-time and can help prevent road accidents by alerting the driver.
